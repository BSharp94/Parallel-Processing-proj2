<h1>Parallel-Processing-proj2</h1>
This is the second Project for my Parallel Processing Class. It compares processing speed for 4 algorithms in 2 environments. The first environment is a standard computer. The second environment is taking advantage of java RMI on a cluster. The 4 algorithms represent different big O notations;O(1),O(n),O(n^2),O(n^3)

still need to

find comment where java RMI is located.
